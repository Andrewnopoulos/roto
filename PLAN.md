- Add leaderboard display in game interface
- Implement basic leaderboard APIs for client consumption

### 4.2 Advanced Leaderboard Features
- Add leaderboard history and position tracking over time
- Implement leaderboard reset schedules for seasonal competition
- Add leaderboard position change notifications
- Create leaderboard integration with matchmaking (show rank changes)

## Phase 5: Competitive Features

### 5.1 Achievement System
- Add achievement system for milestone wins (10, 50, 100+ wins)
- Implement win streak tracking and special recognition
- Create achievement notifications and displays
- Add achievement integration with player profiles

### 5.2 Advanced Competition
- Create daily/weekly challenges and tournaments
- Add ranking badges and titles for top performers
- Implement seasonal competitions
- Add tournament bracket system

## Phase 6: Live Game Mosaic Dashboard

### 6.1 Game Monitoring System
- Create system to track all active games
- Implement enhanced game spectating functionality
- Implement game state broadcasting for spectators
- Add game filtering and search capabilities
- Create game thumbnail generation

### 6.2 Mosaic Landing Page
- Design responsive grid layout for multiple game boards
- Implement mini-board components showing live game states
- Add click-to-spectate functionality
- Create auto-refresh system for live updates
- Integrate leaderboard display alongside live games mosaic
- Add top players showcase and recent winners highlights

### 6.3 Enhanced Viewing Experience
- Add game metadata display (players, game duration, phase, player rankings)
- Implement smooth transitions and animations
- Add featured games highlighting (top-ranked players, close games)
- Create game completion notifications and celebrations
- Add leaderboard position changes and climbing animations

## Phase 7: Production and Polish

### 7.1 Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient WebSocket message batching
- Add client-side caching for game states
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Add connection pooling and load balancing

### 7.2 Advanced Security
- Add advanced anti-cheat measures
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Add DDoS protection and advanced rate limiting
- Secure all API endpoints

### 7.3 Deployment and Monitoring
- Set up production deployment pipeline
- Add application monitoring and logging
- Implement health checks and alerting
- Create backup and recovery procedures

## Technical Stack Recommendations

### Backend
- **Server**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for session/cache
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens or session-based auth

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Keep vanilla JS or migrate to React/Vue for complex state management
- **Styling**: Enhance existing CSS or migrate to Tailwind/SCSS
- **Build**: Webpack/Vite for bundling if complexity increases

### Deployment
- **Hosting**: Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS
- **CDN**: CloudFlare for static assets
- **Monitoring**: DataDog, New Relic, or built-in solutions
